# Inter/sections symposium badges

This repo is empty (I'll let you do the work!) but just want to give you a list of what was on last year's badge:

- 7.5âœ•11 cm
- Front: logo, space for the name, hashtag #MATIntersections, list of sponsors (as text, logos were too big!) and website URL
- Back: the schedule of the symposium (times - event), AND quite importantly the wifi password for the venue

You can get in touch with Tom who should have a copy of it + iterations if needed (it might also be in the 2016 GDrive).

If you want to do things nicely this year you could also re-use the Data Merge technique from [the APP posters](https://github.com/mat-intersections/APP-posters-template) and do a bunch of badges with the names of participants (extracted from Eventbrite, easy to do) already printed, always a nice touch. Do print some extra blank ones though.
